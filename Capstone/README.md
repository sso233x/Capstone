### Backend Setup  

1. Navigate to the backend directory:  
   ```bash
   cd Capstone/backend
   ```
2. Seed the database:
   ```bash
   python3 seed.py
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```
   
### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd Capstone/frontend
   ```
2. Make sure you are using Node version 20 before starting:
   ```bash
   nvm use 20
   ```
3. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
The app will then start in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
